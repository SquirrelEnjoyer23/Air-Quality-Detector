Today i started the project so i started researching some potential sensors i could use but didnt get very far i think i will wait to refine my choices for the next day that way i can make sure i check many possibilities but this project i wanted it to be done within a short period of time i wanted to make use of as many materials as i already have i decided to start looking for a screen that it may use so it is easy to view the data displayed, although down the line it may also be very cool to make a app for a pc that can remotely view the data atleast on the same network, But then funny enough i remembered i actually have a screen being delivered for another project i am working on and it came in a pack with multiple since i intended to have a spare so that was a issue that was solved pretty quickly so i decided to find the measurements that way i could start putting together a 3D model that can hold it after some quick research on the product page i learned that it is about 0.8 inches wide and 1.1 inches tall and with that information in mind i decided to go into onshape and get to work and i made some models

So i can either 3D print it or i could use a spare project box, The plan for it currently is to use a small breadboard and a esp32 and fit it into a container with a small area sticking out for the sensors and a hole cutout to fit in a screen either LCD or OLED so the information from the sensors can be viewed easily, Overall today was a lot of work mostly put into research and developing the idea tommarow comes the fun part of figuring out the technical details!

**Total time spent: 8h (Wow i actually did like a full workday of research LOL)**

Since i now have a solid idea on how i want to execute my plan i just need to figure out the exact parts i want to use but i need to make sure they can ship within a reasonable amount of time as well as they must be cheap enough, luckily for me i already have a few of the pieces i can use, so im going to need sensors to do the heavy lifting here, im going to also need a container to store it all in, a screen, a esp32, and a way to connect it all together, so since i already have a esp32, a project box or i could 3D print that one i designed, and a small oled screen, and a breadboard, so that just leaves me with having to get the sensors i want it to be able to detect VOC's, Temprature, and humidity so it wouldnt be a crazy amount of detail provided to the user, For the sensors i have decided on the DHT20 as it can handle temprature and humidity within a small form factor, And i was able to find a VOC sensor that will work however it was more expensive since i decided the ones on aliexpress didnt have great reviews as most of them said the data either didnt output or was innacurate so ive decided to get one of those but i found one off amazon that i will just pay for myself as i still have left overs on a giftcard so it should turn out fine (Plus i can buy extras for my own future projects) in the end and if i wanted to add more sensors later i could since my esp32 has plenty of pins.

Since yesturday i already figured out the parts today i just needed to figure out the final few pieces so i started by going into onshape and fixing the model up incase i decided to use it so i also made a top that can go on it, Overall this project maybe pretty simple but is actually really cool at least for me as i havent done anything like it before.

**Total time spent: 2h**

I also did some further research so now im certain that these parts will work with my current plan and that i have access to purchase these parts or have access to them already
