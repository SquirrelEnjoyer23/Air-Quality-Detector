Today i started the project so i started researching some potential sensors i could use but didnt get very far i think i will wait to refine my choices for the next day that way i can make sure i check many possibilities but this project i wanted it to be done within a short period of time i wanted to make use of as many materials as i already have i decided to start looking for a screen that it may use so it is easy to view the data displayed, although down the line it may also be very cool to make a app for a pc that can remotely view the data atleast on the same network, But then funny enough i remembered i actually have a screen being delivered for another project i am working on and it came in a pack with multiple since i intended to have a spare so that was a issue that was solved pretty quickly so i decided to find the measurements that way i could start putting together a 3D model that can hold it after some quick research on the product page i learned that it is about 0.8 inches wide and 1.1 inches tall and with that information in mind i decided to go into onshape and get to work and i made some models

So i can either 3D print it or i could use a spare project box, The plan for it currently is to use a small breadboard and a esp32 and fit it into a container with a small area sticking out for the sensors and a hole cutout to fit in a screen either LCD or OLED so the information from the sensors can be viewed easily, Overall today was a lot of work mostly put into research and developing the idea tommarow comes the fun part of figuring out the technical details!

**Total time spent: 8h (Wow i actually did like a full workday of research LOL)**
