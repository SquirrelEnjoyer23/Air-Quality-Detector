# Air-Quality-Detector
A simple air quality detector that utilizes sensors, with a esp32 at the heart!

This device can be helpful for monitoring indoor temprature and humidity, or even finding its way in a 3D printing room or with your spools to make sure they stay in good condition!

This project was made to be fairly cheap and to make use of the components that i had if you want to make this yourself you may have to end up tweaking a few things.

Maybe later on ill even make a web interface or app so you can quickly view the data

## Materials Used:

* Small 3D printed box or project box

* Esp32 - The computer of the build

* OLED Screen - Displays all the data

* DHT20 - Detects the temprature and humidity

* VOC sensor - Detects VOC's in the air

* Breadboard - Connects all the components together
